About
==============

Raccoon is a framework focused in 2D game development made with [FNA](https://github.com/FNA-XNA/FNA), the idea is to provide tools to easily make games with FNA running under the hood.

It's originally designed for my personal use, but feel free to suggest or make a pull request anything you find relevant.
