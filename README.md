# About

Raccoon is a framework focused in 2D game development, the idea is to provide tools to easily make games with minimal code.

*You should focus on building the game itself, not the tools to do that.*

It's designed for my personal use, but feel free to use it as a whole or slices of it.
As pull requests and suggestions are very appreaciated, I'm not accepting anything right now, as I can't review others code at this moment.

This is a work in progress to help me build my upcoming game title. Things can, and will, change drastically through development and as I learn more and more things.
Some parts of it are more stable than others.

To a quick view, see [architecture.md](/architecture.md).

XNA 4.0 well made reimplementation, provides the rendering, input, audio to make everything running in several platforms.

- [Otter2d](http://otter2d.com/):
An excellent C# framework built on SFML 2, without it this project would never happen. That was my introduction to C# and how a real game framework works. Because of that, some concepts are similar and others changed through time to fit my needs.
