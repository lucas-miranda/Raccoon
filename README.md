# About

Raccoon is a framework focused in 2D game development, the idea is to provide tools to easily make games with minimal code, you should focus on building the game itself, not the tools to do that.

It's originally designed for my personal use, but feel free to suggest or make a pull request anything you find relevant.

This is a work in progress to help me build an upcoming game title. Things can, and will, change drastically through development and as I learn more things.

# Attribution

XNA 4.0 well made reimplementation, provides the rendering, input, audio to make everything running in several platforms.

- [Otter2d](http://otter2d.com/):
An excellent C# framework built on SFML 2, without it this project would never happen. That was my introduction to C# and how a real game framework works. Because of that, some concepts are similar and others changed through time to fit my needs.
